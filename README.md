## Learn Three.js in REACT Way

  <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" color="blue.500">
    Three.js
  </a> is an awesome library that makes the Web 3D development a lot easier.


  However, from this <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_cloth.html" target="_blank"> official documentation code example</a>, creating **meshes**, **objects**, **materials**, **lights**, **render loops**, and so on in imperaitve way is not really my thing. What my favorite style is
  creating everything in <b>declarative, more functional, and component-based objects!</b> That is what React looks like.



  Special thanks to the three.js react renderer <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber" target="_blank">react-three/fiber</a> which makes everything happen in React world.
